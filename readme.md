# Responsive Image Code Generator

#### This is a simple tool for generating HTML and CSS code for responsive images. You can input an image URL, width, and height, and the tool will generate the code for a responsive image that will adjust its size to fit the container.

## How the code works

<br>


#### The generator uses the entered width and height to calculate the aspect ratio of the image, and then applies that ratio to the `padding-top` property of a container div. This ensures that the container div maintains the same aspect ratio as the image, and the image scales proportionally.

#### The CSS code generated by the application includes a class called `.box`, which represents the container div. The class has a `position: relative` property, and the image has a `position: absolute` property, so that the image can be centered within the container. The class also has a `padding-top` property equal to the aspect ratio of the image, which ensures that the container maintains the same aspect ratio as the image.

## Why padding-top?

<br>


#### `Padding-top` is used to set the height of the container div, because it allows the div to maintain its aspect ratio even as the width of the page changes. This is because padding is calculated as a percentage of the width of the containing element, not the height. By setting the `padding-top` property to a percentage value equal to the aspect ratio of the image, the container div will maintain its aspect ratio, and the image will scale proportionally.
